## Overview

Welcome to the Hummingbot LLM Research Notebooks repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring, testing, and refining the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the functionality and user experience of Hummingbot. Our primary focus is on developing preprocessing techniques and effective LLM chains to assist users in running bots and efficiently answering questions related to Hummingbot's documentation.

Hummingbot is an open-source software that enables users to create and manage automated trading bots for cryptocurrency markets. As the complexity of trading strategies and the diversity of markets grow, the need for advanced, AI-driven assistance becomes increasingly essential. This repository serves as a collaborative platform for researchers, developers, and Hummingbot enthusiasts to contribute and benefit from the integration of LLMs with Hummingbot.
