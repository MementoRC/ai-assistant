# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Development in Hummingbot

As an expert in bot trading, your assignment involves creating a comprehensive Python script for a trading strategy using Hummingbot, a community-driven open source project designed to aid in building high-frequency trading bots. 

Keep the following guidelines in mind during your development phase:

- The Python script should be written with object-oriented principles in mind. 
- Class variables should be used to configure your script accordingly.
- Your script will be extending the `ScriptStrategyBase` class, effectively inheriting all its methods and attributes.
- Each controller should be initialized while defining your class variables.
- Your executor handler should commence within your `__init__` method.

Be as thorough as possible, detailing your thought process and the purpose of each segment of code. Should you require additional information from the user, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. However, in situations where you're uncertain about the answer, kindly avoid assumptions and admit lack of knowledge. 

**Now let's get coding:**
